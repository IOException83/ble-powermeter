# Arduino BLE Cycling Power Meter
Code for emulating a cycling power meter with an ESP32.
This uses the same hardware as <a href="https://github.com/kswiorek/ble-ftms">ble-ftms</a> <br/>
The code is much uglier, so if you want more information, go to my other project and the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Indoor-Bike-Smart-Trainer/">instructable</a>
